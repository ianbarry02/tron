# TRON

The Transcoding & Remuxing Operations Nucleus (TRON) is an app that streamlines video conversion and quality comparison of converted video files in a GUI. TRON uses the FFmpeg toolbox in MatLab to: 1) convert .mxf, .avi, and .mkv files to .mp4 files, and 2) generate commands that can be copied and pasted into the terminal window to compare the quality of a converted video file against the original video file.
